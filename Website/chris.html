				<h2> Biography </h2>

				<p> 
					 Currently working towards a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at NAU. I'm in my 4th year and still undecided about which field of computer science that I want to really dedicate myself to. I'm pretty torn between Web Development and Game Design at the moment, however I'm currently taking Artificial Intelligence and I plan to take a Cybersecurity course next semester. I've been interested in CS since a young age thanks to very early exposure to video games through friends.

I get to pull from all the mechanics I've experienced and add unique twists and combinations, typically making for really cool gameplay.
