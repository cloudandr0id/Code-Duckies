				<h2> Biography </h2>

				<p> 
					 While most of my life I was raised in Mesa, Arizona, I believe that the time that I spent in the Philippines from 2014-2016 followed by my time studying at Eastern Arizona College, and working on my bachelors in computer science at NAU has made me what I am today. I have always been interested in computers and wanted to work in the ever changing, complex field of technology.

				<h2> Other Interests: </h2>

				<p>
					I try to balance my life between family, school, work, and my church responsibilities. My wife and I enjoy playing any kind of game together (board, card, or video games), and when I can I like to sit with my son and play with him and his toys while trying to create an environment for him to learn as well. My free time is spent listening to music or playing music on the piano or organ as a way to unwind from stressful days.
