					Self-driving vehicles are a field currently undergoing major innovation, 
					with the potential for massive changes to the global economy. 
					However, programming them requirs an in-depth knowledge of programming languages such as Python and C++. 
					Our sponser, Dr. Truong Nghiem, wants to create a Summer camp course that teaches this technology to middle school aged children.
					For this, he needs a simpler way of programming. That's why we're developing a visual programming tool, 
					that represents blocks of Python and C++ code as visual blocks that students can drag and drop.
					This would allow for children to be introduced to programming self-driving vehicles at a much younger age.
