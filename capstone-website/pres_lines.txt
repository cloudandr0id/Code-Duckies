
By utilizing Duckietown and they're prebuilt Duckie bots, 
our client aims to bring autonoymous driving cars to a younger age

Currently, due to the complex nature of Duckietown's inner workings
(so how it uses python and C++ complexly to control the bots) 
it requires a significant level of technical prowess that might not 
be intuitive to students at even a college level

Thus its not very feasible for middleschool and highschool students to 
wrap their heads around concepts like Machine AI or Computer Vision
