# Code-Duckies: Visual Programming Tool for Duckiebots

Our team has developed a visual programming tool for the Duckietown platform. This allows children with no prior programming experience to learn how to program self-driving cars! It will be used to teach kids at a summer camp course taught by our sponsor, Dr. Truong Nghiem, and hopefully lead to greater interest in the field of autonomous vehicles!

## Use
Programming a duckiebot developed by MIT's Duckietown by using a Blockly interface instead of C++ and Python code. There are basic blocks but then there are different custom blocks that allow for forward, backwards, left, and right movement. Some more advanced blocks are a distance sensor block and odometry data blocks.
